            <h2>Bladesinger, Wizard</h2>
            <p>The Bladesinger, Wizard is by far my favorite D&D class to date. Wizards themselves are cool enough, but Bladesinger's utilize both magic and melee to bring down their foes. While they do lack hitpoints, they have an above average AC and, like a normal Wizard, have the capability to learn every Wizard spell should they come across it."</p>

            <h2>Battlemaster, Fighter</h2>
            <p>The Battlemaster, Fighter is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to play a melee class and isn't worried about magic. Fighters have above average hit points and can have some wicked AC, depending on how you build your character. The coolest part of Battlemasters is their ability to use maneuvers during battle. For example, the Evasive Footwork maneuver allows you to, while moving, roll a die and add the number to your AC until you stop moving.</p>

            <h2>Assassin, Rogue</h2>
            <p>The Assassin, Rogue is your typical sneaky type. While most people like to have their rogues use daggers, I personally like to have them use bow and snipe my enemies from far away. After all, rogues definitely are light on hit points. I like the Assassin class specifically because of their late-game ability Death Strike, which allows them to get double damage on their strikes if they surprise their enemies. Couple that with sneak attack and you're going to average 60 damage on sneak attack ALONE!</p>

            <h2>Shadow Origin, Sorcerer</h2>
            <p>Shadow Origin, Sorcerers are very entertaining and strange at the same time. They were exposed to dark magic and due to that, dark energy envelops them. Mechanically, their magic is pretty straightforward, but they do have a list of quirks that makes things interesting. For example, they never blink or when they sleep, they don't appear to breathe. My favorite ability is the Shadow Walk ability. With it, these sorcerers are able to step from shadow to another and, in dim light or darkness, teleport up to 120 feet away!</p>

            <h2>The Way of Open Hand, Monk</h2>
            <p>Last but not least, The Way of Open Hand, Monk. The popular consensus is monks are overpowered. I'm sure if I agree with that statement, but these particular monks are pretty intense. The Quivering Palm ability at level 17 is simply insane. When you hit a creature who fails their saving throw, the enemy is reduced to 0 hit points outright! If they suceed, they take 10d10 damage! Even if you roll the average, that's still 50 points!</p>
